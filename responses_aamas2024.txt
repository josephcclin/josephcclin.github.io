Response to Reviewer #1: 

We thank the reviewer for the affirmation and comments. Below we give responses to the questions.

1. "One comment, in the contribution section, it would be nice if research goals and findings could be lined up.  There are 3 goals, and four findings...." 

>Response: Thanks for pointing out this. Here it simply states that we obtain even more findings that are beyond our original goals. 

2. Question for Authors: Could you please publish a github location for the code that you used to compute all the numbers.

>Response: Thanks for the comment. We will provide a github location for the codes of generating the experimental simulations after the paper is accepted.

Response to Reviewer #2: 

We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. We respond to the comments as follows. 

1. The motivation for EGs seems sound, although the authors could possibly do a better job of illustrating what specific phenomena relevant to real-world elections the EG model captures well and how the game-theoretic solution concepts can provide novel insights. 

>Response: Thanks for the comments. We agree that this work will have more impact if some real-world examples can be given to further justify our game-theoretic findings.

2. For example, in the “general form” representation of an EG, it is not made clear what the “deterministic Turing machine” is meant to represent, or what computational restrictions are imposed on it. 

>Response: Thanks for the comments. The deterministic Turing machine here, which follows \`{A}lvarez et al.'s work, simply denotes a deterministic algorithm. As stated in our manuscript, we consider the “general form” as the game-theoretical setting in which the payoff of a player needs to be computed instead of an entry provided in the payoff matrix as a oracle. Hence our computational hardness makes sense with respect to this setting.

3. Another example of a flawed, and hence incoherent, definition the definition of fixed-parameter tractability, in which no explanation is given for what the meaning of variable n is. 

>Response: Thanks for pointing out this. In Sect. 2 (Preliminaries), n = max_i n_i has been defined as the maximum number of candidates in a party. Nevertheless, readers might forget the definitions of variables when there are many of them. We will consider to add a remark or a table of defined variables in the future journal version.  

4. When examples of games are given (for example, as described in Tables 1-3), they are claimed to have been obtained “through program simulations” (what does it mean?!), and they are full of rather arbitrary numbers, significantly obscuring what concepts and phenomena they are meant to illustrate. 

>Response: Thanks for pointing out this. The purpose of program simulations is to establish the existence of a election game instance which does not possess any pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Although we have Theorem 4.1 which provides the sufficient condition for the election game to have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, it is still not easy to find an example in which there is no pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. In our “program simulations”, we generate election game instances with randomly assigned utilities, and we found that only a rare number of instances which do not have any pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Again, we thank the reviewer for this comment. It could be interesting to investigate or justify the probability of such a game does not have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.  

5. The proofs of most technical results are only sketched unconvincingly or relegated to an appendix, which limits the scope for proper scrutiny of accuracy and validity of claims made in a conference paper under tight peer reviewing timelines.  Such concerns can be moderated by consistent accuracy and rigour of all technical statements made within the page limits of the main paper, but this is unfortunately not the case with this paper. 

>Response: Thanks for the comments. Due to the page limit, though we omit the technical proofs, we give concise explanations of the Theorems. For example, before Theorem 3.1, we stated that “The proof of the NP-completeness of determining PNE existence in an egoistic election game is built upon a reduction from the Satisfiability problem, which resembles the arguments in [1] but is revised elaborately to deal with the egoistic property and monotonicity”. 

6. Your paper could benefit from some friendly proof-reading by a fluent English speaker/writer. 

>Response: Thanks for the suggestion. In the future journal version, we will consider professional English editing service to polish our manuscript. 

7. Can you simplify the examples (which you seem to have come up with using computer simulations!?), for example by replacing arbitrary numbers with simpler ones?  Examples and counterexamples should illustrate concepts that you want to exhibit or highlight in a clearest possible way, rather than obscure them by the presence of arbitrary numbers.

>Response: Thanks for the suggestion and comments. We have responded in above (4.). Since it is not easy to come up such counterexamples by hand and such examples are rare, we wrote a program to simulate the game instances to find them.

Response to Reviewer #3: 

We thank the reviewer for the affirmation and comments. We respond to the comments as follows. 

1. I feel that the novelty is a bit limited. The paper examines somewhat expected extensions of previous work. The author(s) claim that their results on price of anarchy provide an explanation alternative to Duverger's law. But I think more clarification is needed here, for instance, why the natural function is not too restrictive. 
----------- Questions for Authors -----------
Could you please address the comment about how restrictive the natural function assumption may be?

>Response: Thanks for the comments. Natural functions, softmax functions, hardmax functions, etc., are illustrated as the winning probability functions which make the election game “monotone”. In such game instances, we can even find that a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium does not exist when there are three or more parties. However, in the previous work, the authors showed that the two-party election game under the egoistic and monotone guarantee, the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium always exists when the winning probablity function is the softmax or a linear function. So we can conclude that the election game is unstable when there are more than two parties. Moreover, as mentioned by the reviewer, from the point of view of price of anarchy, election game of more parties has higher price of anarchy. Due to these reasons, we claim that our results provide an alternative explanation of Duverger's law. 

As to the natural function, it only serves as an example of winning probability function. In Sect. 5.2, we provide the general result, which considers all monotone winning probability funtions in general. So, yes, the natural function is restrictive, but is clear to exemplify the monotone election game. Thanks again for giving these comments and we will clarify these points better in the future journal version.
