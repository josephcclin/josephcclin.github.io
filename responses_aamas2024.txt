Response to Reviewer #1: 

We thank the reviewer for the affirmation and comments. Below we give responses to the questions

1. "One comment, in the contribution section, it would be nice if research goals and findings could be lined up.  There are 3 goals, and four findings...." 

Response: Thanks for pointing out this. Here it simply presents that we obtain even more findings that are beyond our original goals. 

2. Question for Authors: Could you please publish a github location for the code that you used to compute all the numbers.

Response: Thanks for the commnet. We will provide a github location for the codes of generating the experimental simulations after the paper is accepted.
