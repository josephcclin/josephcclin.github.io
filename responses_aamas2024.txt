Response to Reviewer #1: 

We thank the reviewer for the affirmation and comments. Below we give responses to the questions.

1. "There are 3 goals, and four findings...." 

>Response: Thanks. Here it means that we obtain even more findings that are beyond our original goals. 

2. “Could you please publish a github location for the code that you used to compute all the numbers.”

>Response: No problem. We will put a footnote including the code's GitHub location somewhere near the experimental simulations when we revise our paper.

Response to Reviewer #2: 

We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. We respond to the comments as follows. 

1. The motivation for EGs seems sound, although the authors could possibly do a better job of illustrating what specific phenomena relevant to real-world elections the EG model captures well and how the game-theoretic solution concepts can provide novel insights. 

>Response: Thanks and we agree that this work will have more impact by doing so. 

2. In the “general form” representation of an EG, it is not made clear what the “deterministic Turing machine” is meant to represent, or what computational restrictions are imposed on it. 

>Response: The deterministic Turing machine here, which follows \`{A}lvarez et al.'s work, simply denotes a deterministic algorithm. As stated in our manuscript, the payoff of a player needs to be computed and is not directly provided in the input so that the computational hardness makes sense. 

3. Another example of a flawed, and hence incoherent, definition the definition of fixed-parameter tractability, in which no explanation is given for what the meaning of variable n is. 

>Response: In Sect. 2 (Preliminaries), n = max_i n_i has been defined as the maximum number of candidates in a party. Thanks for the comment and we will add a remark or a table of variables when we revise our paper.  

4. When examples of games are given (for example, as described in Tables 1-3), they are claimed to have been obtained “through program simulations” (what does it mean?!), and they are full of rather arbitrary numbers, significantly obscuring what concepts and phenomena they are meant to illustrate. 

>Response: Thanks for pointing out this. The purpose of program simulations is to establish the existence of an election game instance which does not possess any pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PNE). We will put a footnote including the code's GitHub location somewhere near the experimental simulations when we revise our paper. 

5. The proofs of most technical results are only sketched unconvincingly or relegated to an appendix, which limits the scope for proper scrutiny of accuracy and validity of claims made in a conference paper under tight peer reviewing timelines. 

>Response: Thanks for the comments. We gave concise explanations for most the Theorems. For example, before Theorem 3.1, we stated that “The proof of the NP-completeness of determining PNE existence in an egoistic election game is built upon a reduction from the Satisfiability problem, which resembles the arguments in [1] but is revised elaborately to deal with the egoistic property and monotonicity”. 

6. Your paper could benefit from some friendly proof-reading by a fluent English speaker/writer. Can you simplify the examples (which you seem to have come up with using computer simulations!?), for example by replacing arbitrary numbers with simpler ones?  Examples and counterexamples should illustrate concepts that you want to exhibit or highlight in a clearest possible way, rather than obscure them by the presence of arbitrary numbers.

>Response: When we revise the manuscript, we will consider professional English editing service to polish our manuscript. As responded in (4.), a footnote including the code's GitHub location will be placed when we revise our paper.

Response to Reviewer #3: 

We thank the reviewer for the affirmation and comments. We respond to the comments as follows. 

1. The author(s) claim that their results on price of anarchy provide an explanation alternative to Duverger's law. But I think more clarification is needed here, for instance, why the natural function is not too restrictive. 
Could you please address the comment about how restrictive the natural function assumption may be?

>Response: Thanks for the comments. The natural function only serves as an example of winning probability function. Our general result considers any monotone winning probability functions in general. Together with the counterexamples that the election game with three or more parties do not always have a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we claim that our results provide an alternative explanation of Duverger's law since the two-party election game is more stable and has the smallest price of anarchy. 
We will clarify these points better when we revise the manuscript.
