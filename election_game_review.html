<h2>TO-DO LIST of revising the manuscript for SAGT 2023</h2>

<li>The phrasing of some claims is not clear; one needs to then read the proof to get the meaning of the claim.</li>
=>
<li>Discuss games around elections:
<ul class="list2">
<li>Ding and Lin, On Computing Optimal Strategies in Open List Proportional Representation: the Two Parties Case, AAAI-14</li>
<li>Laslier, Interpretation of electoral mixed strategies, Social Choice and Welfare 17</li>
<li>Harrenstein et al., A Hotelling-Downs Framework for Party Nominees, AAMAS-21</li>
<li>Sabato et al., Real candidacy games: A new model for strategic candidacy, AAMAS-17</li>
</ul>
</li>		
<li>Discuss the area of <b>primaries</b> (which is the process of selecting party nominees):</li>
<ul class="list2">
<li>Borodin et al., Primarily about Primaries, AAAI-19</li>
</ul>
<li>Discuss the topic of nominating an election winner:</li>
<ul class="list2">
<li>Faliszewski et al., How Hard Is It for a Party to Nominate an Election Winner?, IJCAI-16</li>		
</ul>
<li>It seems to me that parties rather ignore any utility contribution that their supporters get from other winning parties. 
Anyway, if the party loses they are not going to care about the utility of their candidate.  Otherwise, if the party wins, 
the party wants have their own electorate as happy as possible. Assuming the proposed payoff, it seems to me that it might 
be beneficial for a party, to nominate its epsilon-worse candidate, if for the price of this epsilon utility loss, the party's 
supporters get more than epsilon utility in expectancy (this appear to could happen if the summation terms coming from other 
parties' nominees give a value bigger than something like epsilon^2). This, however, does not look as a strategically-correct 
nomination. So, it seems a more natural payoff would be simply the probability that the party's supporters get multiplied by 
the utility of the party's nominee for the party's supporters. Summarizing, I am not convinced by this choice of function 
(maybe I am missing something obvious?).
</li>
=> We regard a party, which consists of its supporters, as a collective concept. A candidate will be nominated by the supporters of the party to compete in an election campaign. 
Supporters of a party can benefit not only from the candidate nominated for them but also from that from the competing party.
